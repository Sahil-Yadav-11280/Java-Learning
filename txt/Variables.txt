1. Instance Variables (Non-Static Fields)

    Instance variables are declared inside a class but outside any method. They represent the "state" of an object.

    Scope: Accessible by all methods in the class.

    Lifetime: They are created when an object is instantiated (using new) and destroyed when the object is garbage collected.

    Key Characteristic: Each object has its own copy. If you have two Car objects, one can be "Red" and the other "Blue."
    
    class Car {
    String color; // Instance variable
    }


2. Class Variables (Static Fields)
    
    Class variables are declared with the static keyword inside a class but outside any method.
    
    Scope: Accessible by all static methods in the class.
    
    Lifetime: They are created when the program starts (or when the class is first loaded) and exist until the program stops.
    
    Key Characteristic: There is only one copy shared by all instances of the class. If one object changes a static variable, it changes for every other object of that class.
    
    class Car {
    static int numberOfWheels = 4; // Class variable (shared by all cars)
    }


3. Local Variables
    
    Local variables are declared inside a method, constructor, or a block of code (like a loop).
    
    Scope: Only visible within the specific method or block where they are defined.
    
    Lifetime: They are created when the method is called and destroyed as soon as the method finishes.
    
    Initialization: Unlike instance/class variables, local variables do not get a default value. You must initialize them before use, or the code won't compile.
    
    void drive() {
    int speed = 60; // Local variable
    System.out.println(speed);
    }


4. Parameters

    Parameters (or Arguments) are the variables listed in a method's definition. They act as "placeholders" for values passed into the method.
    
    Scope: Entirely local to the method they belong to.
    
    Role: They allow you to pass data from one part of the program into a specific behavior.
    
    void setSpeed(int newSpeed) { 
    // 'newSpeed' is a parameter
    System.out.println("Setting speed to: " + newSpeed);
    }
